# sharp-roller
My third attempt at a project made for a tabletop game, which includes rolling a bunch of dice, and looking up results on a lot of tables. 
Made as my introduction to C#.

See my [first](https://github.com/looseMole/wildmagic-roller) and [second](https://github.com/looseMole/read-excel-files/) attempts at this project.
